## Cloud Files

In this directory, contains main config files that works at the cloud server, outside of this project.

- `nginx.conf`: Configuration file for Nginx web server.
- `main-docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration file that already exist outside of this project. Contains all the services running at the cloud server, except this project.
